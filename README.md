# Rush-Hour-State-Space-Search
In this project, state space search algorithms were implemented to solve the game Rush Hour. Uninformed search, Uniform Cost, and informed searches Greedy-Best First Search and Algorithms A/A*. All game logic and data structures were implemented with an original design. 

To get the solution and search path, you must create a directory inside the main directory as follows:

- Output
  - Search
  - Solution
  
The search paths will be stored inside the search folder, and the solutions will be stored in the solution folder. For further documentation please refer to the assignment pdf, as well as the inline documentation inside of the notebook.
